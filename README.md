# L-Systems
L-Systems made in Unity- Standalone application.
This project and all of its files are property of Giacomo Mazza only. This project can be used in a non-commercial way when properly attributed as written below:

//L-System solution made by Giacomo Mazza --- 2019/2020 --- postagiacomo@gmail.com

The code can be changed, but every change must be explicitly written down in this read file and where the code has been changed. This applies to any variation and iteration and derivative of the code. This license must not be modified or removed from the project either.

This code and its variations can be used commercially only if every single employee of the company that uses this code dances to the rythm of this song for its entire duration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWPPD5ww0eA&t0s on a daily basis since when this code or any of its variation is used in the project, until the project is no longer used (this also applies after the project has been published). This needs to be recorded on a daily basis and every video must be presented if asked so by the owner of this code and its variations, iterations, and derivatives.

Shall this code or any of its variations be used by individuals and not a company, the individuals will still have to dance and record themselves as per written above.

Shall the link not be available or cease to exist, the song to dance to will be the first one when searching "D&D song 10 hours".

All changes to this code and to its changed variations belong to the author of this project.

Notes: the code can be improved by adding for loops instead of... those things.
